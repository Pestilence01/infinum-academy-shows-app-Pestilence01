# infinum-academy-shows-app-Pestilence01

The purpose of this project is to make a fully fledged Android application for TV shows. 

The project can be imported via Android Studio IDE like so: file -> new -> import project 
                                                            Then click on the project folder
                                                            
It is also important to note that the API used for this application is API 31 (Android 12) 
The application can be tested using an integrated emulator inside Android Studio or through your own Android device (Make sure to enable USB debugging!) 

The application allows users to login with their email address and a password (the password has to be at least 6 characters long!) 

# The more the application develops, the more information I will add in this README 
                                                            		
		
I will be updating the README as the application develops. If you are interested in the development of the app, checkout the CHANGELOG.md as it lists in detail every major update in this application's progress
