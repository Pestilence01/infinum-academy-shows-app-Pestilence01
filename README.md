# infinum-academy-shows-app-Pestilence01

The purpose of this project is to make a fully fledged Android application for TV shows. 

The project can be imported via Android Studio IDE like so: file -> new -> import project 
                                                            Then click on the project folder
                                                            
It is also important to note that the API used for this application is API 31 (Android 12) 
The application can be tested using an integrated emulator inside Android Studio or through your own Android device (Make sure to enable USB debugging!) 
                                                            
Changelog: 

	Assignment1: 
		This is the very beginning of the project which was created with only one empty activity which consists of one textview inside a constraint layout which says "Hello World!"
		
		
I will be updating the README as the application develops.
